## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Destop-first workflow


### What I learned

I wonder how I will do this if I hadn't understand grid. The moment I understood grid, I embarked on the project which I didn't regret. I used this project to practice my grid layouts.

```html

```
```css
    .grid-container {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 250px);
        grid-template-areas: 
        ".three."
        "one three two"
        "one four two"
        ".four.";
    }
```
```js

```

### Continued development

Well, I want to move animation and transition

### Useful resources

- [Learn grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This helped because it helped understand grid better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
